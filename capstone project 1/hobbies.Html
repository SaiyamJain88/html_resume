    <h1>Hobbies of Saiyam Jain</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2><li>Playing Games</li></h2>
        <p>Playing games has always been one of my favorite activities, and for good reason. Games are not just a source of entertainment; they are a gateway to creativity, strategy, and learning. They allow me to immerse myself in exciting challenges and explore different worlds, all while enhancing my problem-solving and decision-making skills.</p>
        <h2><li>Coding</li></h2>
        <p>Coding has become one of my favorite activities because it combines creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning. It’s like a puzzle where each piece I write brings a solution closer, and the possibilities are endless.What excites me most about coding is the ability to build something from scratch. Whether it’s creating a website, designing an app, or automating a task, the sense of accomplishment after seeing my code come to life is unmatched. It’s empowering to know that with a few lines of code, I can solve real-world problems or make ideas a reality.</p>
        <h2><li>Innovation</li></h2>
        <p>Innovation is something I deeply admire because it represents creativity, progress, and the power to make a difference. It’s about looking at the world through a lens of curiosity and daring to challenge the status quo. For me, innovation is not just about creating new things—it’s about finding better, smarter, and more meaningful ways to solve problems and improve lives. </p>
